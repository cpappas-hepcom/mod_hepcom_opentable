Hepcom OpenTable Module for Joomla 1.5 - jQuery UI
==================================================

Joomla 1.5 Module to display a form compatible with OpenTable.com's reservation system. I altered it to use jQuery UI to display the date picker,
as the script provided by OpenTable had some issues with z-indexing etc.

Can also include the jQuery and jQuery UI scripts and even specify which theme to use. All content is loaded from the Google Code repository.

###Joomla 1.5 Administrator Features:

* may specify the restaurant_id and geo_id for properly directing the reservations
* toggle whether the various jQuery resources are loaded... if you are already loading jQuery elsewhere then you can turn it off to save some bandwidth and redundant processing time.
